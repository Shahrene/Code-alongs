# why automated testing why Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. We write test to PROVE your code does what you THINK it does.

2. tests help define the problem you are trying to solve.

3. tests help you to verify that new changes or refactors don't break the rest of your code.

```ruby
def get_age(year_of_birth)



end

```
